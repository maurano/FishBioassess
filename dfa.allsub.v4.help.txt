DESCRIPTION:
Performs all-subsets linear discriminant function (DF) analysis, for purposes of exploring candidate predictive models.

USAGE:
  
dfm.best<-dfa.allsub.v4(bugcal, bugvld, predcal, predvld, grps, candvar, numkeep, Pc);


ARGUMENTS:
    
 bugcal:  Site (rows) by species (columns) matrix containing 0's or 1's, denoting the
              absence or presence, respectively, of species at reference calibration sites. 
              Column names should contain species names or other identifying codes. Row
              names should contain site identifiers. Missing values not allowed.

 bugvld:  Site by species matrix of same type as bugcal, but containing species 
                presence/absence data for a different set of sites. Typically, these are data from
                reference sites used for model validation. Column names and column order 
                should match exactly with those of bugcal. Row names contain site or sample 
                ID's. Missing values not allowed.

predcal:   Matrix or data frame of candidate DF predictor variables (columns) for 
                reference calibration sites (rows). Row names (sites) must match those of 
                bugcal and have same order. Column names are variable names. Missing values
                not allowed.

predvld:  Matrix or data frame of candidate DF predictor variables (columns) for 
                the sites (rows) corresponding to bugvld. Row names (sites) must match those
                of bugvld and have same order. Column names must match those of predcal
                and have the same order.

grps:       Vector identifying the group membership of each calibration site. Must have
                length equal to the row dimension of bugcal. Typically the output of a pruned
               dendrogram from a cluster analysis of calibration sites.

candvar:   Vector of names of desired candidate DF predictor variables. Must be a subset
                 of the column names of predcal and predvld. 

numkeep: Vector of same length as candvar specifying how many 'best' DF models to
                  retain and further analyze. The kth element of numkeep specifies the number
                  of models to retain that contain k predictors.

Pc:          Occurrence probability cutoff. All species at a site with model-predicted 
               occurrence probabilities >= Pc will be included in the O/E calculation for that 
               site. Typically, this is a very small positive number, such as 0.0000001, to
        		   specify inclusion of all species, or else it is 0.5, to specify inclusion of only 
         		   common species.



DETAILS: 

	The function first uses 1-way ANOVA or MANOVA on the calibration data to compute the Wilks lambda
  measure of group separation, for all possible combinations of candidate predictors. For each model 
  order (number of predictors in the model), a small set of 'best' models is retained, as specified 
  by numkeep. The best models of any order are those with the smallest Wilks lambda (maximal 
  group separation), among all possible models of that order. 
	Then, each of the 'best' models is refitted to the calibration data as 
  a linear DF model, using lda() of the MASS package. Resubstitution and 
  leave-one-out crossvalidation classification accuracies are reported for 
  the calibration data. Each 'best' model is also used to predict expected 
  richness (E) for the calibration and 'validation' data sets, and the 
  resulting statistics of O/E and BC are reported. The Pc cutoff specifies the 
  commonness level of taxa to be included in calculations of O/E and BC.

VALUE:
	During function execution, statistics of O/E and BC are printed for the null model 
  (Van Sickle et al., 2005). Upon completion, the function value (dfm.best) is 
  a list containing 3 components: 
        
	The first component (subset.stats) is a data frame with each 
   row reporting one "best" model, using the following columns:

order – Model order.

F.stat, Wilks – Wilks lambda and its approximate F-statistic for the overall model.

cls.crct.resub, cls.crct.cv – Resubstitution and leave-one-out crossvalidation classification
                              accuracies for calibration sites. Classifications employ group
                              priors proportional to group occurrence frequency in the
                              calibration data (Clarke et al. 1996)

MNOE.cal, SDOE.cal, RMSE.cal – Mean, standard deviation and root-mean-squared
                                  error for O/E at calibration sites.

SDRS.cal – Replicate-sampling standard deviation of O/E at calibration sites.

MNOE.vld, SDOE.vld, RMSE.vld – Mean, standard deviation and root-mean-squared
                                  error for O/E at validation sites.

BCMD.cal, BC90.cal, BCMD.vld, BC90.vld  - Statistics of the BC measure for calibration(.cal)
                                         and validation (.vld) sites. "MD" denotes the median
                                         and "90" the 90th percentile. BC measures the Bray-Curtis
                                         dissimilarity between observed and expected assemblages.

model – Predictors in the model.

        The second component (null.stats) is a vector of named statistics for null model O/E and BC.
        The third component (CV.error.matrices) is a list containing the CV confusion (error) matrix 
     for each of the "best" models.  


USAGE NOTES AND WARNINGS: 

1) If validation data is not available, then you can re-use the calibration
   data (species and predictor data) as placeholders for bugvld and predvld.

2) During predictions of expected richness, sites are not tested for 
  whether they may be outliers in predictor space, relative to the 
  groups of calibration sites (Clarke et al. 1996). 

3) BEWARE of large models!  Dfa.allsub.v4 screens all of the (2^p-1) models 
  that can be formed from p candidate predictors. For p = 14, execution 
  requires about 5 minutes on a 2.8 Ghz machine under Windows XP. 
  Each additional candidate predictor will approximately double the execution time.

4) This version of dfa.allsub does not check whether the 
  design matrix of predictors is well-conditioned. In the 
  special case of an exact linear dependence among predictors, 
  an error message concerning model residuals is produced by manova(), 
  and dfa.allsub terminates. Exact linear dependence commonly happens 
  when too many dummy (0,1) variables are used as candidates, to represent, 
  e.g., regions or geologic types. A similar error occurs if all values of 
  a candidate predictor variable are identical (e.g., = 0) at 
  the calibration sites.
