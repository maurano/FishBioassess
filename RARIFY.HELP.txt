R function for rarefaction (i.e., subsampling), of a 
benthic count data set, to produce subsamples with a 
user-specified fixed total count.

into the command window, or else do: source(”mypath/RARIFY.R”)
  
   Then execute as shown below.

DESCRIPTION:
Accepts an input data frame containing raw abundance counts of 
individual taxa. Each row of the input data is assumed to 
give the abundance (count) of a single taxon in a single 
sample. Produces an output data frame identical to the input data, 
except that the taxon abundances are those of a fixed-count 
subsample of the input data.

USAGE:
outbug <- rarify(inbug, sample.ID, abund, subsiz)


ARGUMENTS:  

inbug:  Input data frame with each row containing the 
        count of a taxon in a single sample. 

sample.ID: The column (variable) name, in quotes, of 
           inbug that contains a unique ID for each sample.

abund:  The column (variable) name, in quotes, of inbug 
        that contains the nonzero abundances (counts) of taxa.  

subsiz: Positive integer specifying the desired fixed 
        count size for each rarified sample.



DETAILS:  The function loops through all samples, 
          randomly selecting (without replacement) a total 
          of subsiz individuals from each. If an input sample 
          has total count less than or equal to subsiz, 
          then it is returned unaltered in the output data set.


VALUE:  A data frame (outbug) that is identical to the 
        input set, except that abundances are replaced by 
        the subsampled abundances for each taxon. During 
        execution, the function prints sample ID's to the 
        screen as each sample is processed.


WARNINGS: Prior to using RARIFY.R, any rows with missing 
          values for either the sample.ID or the abund 
          columns should be removed from the input data set.
